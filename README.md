# minimage
Minimal html5 image editor : https://minimage.tk

How it works :
- tap anywhere to load a file
- draw on it
- tap the colored background to change the drawing color
- tap download to download
- reload the page to start a new edit

I got tired of having no default app on my phone to draw on images. So I made a very, very simple one. It's quick and dirty code, unminified, and it probably breaks on many browsers :) You dont need to install it so it doesn't take MB of your internal storage.

Feel free to do PRs to make it work better on your setup. Just dont add buttons or libs. It would be nice to have it work offline, allow zooming in an elegant manner, etc ..
